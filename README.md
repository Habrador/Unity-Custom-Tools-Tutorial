# Unity Custom Tools Tutorial

Source code for my custom tools tutorial in Unity: https://www.habrador.com/tutorials/editor-scripting/ 

Notice that the source code is not exactly the same as in the tutorial because it's easier to update the code on GitHub, but the basic idea is the same. 


## Part 1. Add prefabs within circle

It's kinda boring to add prefabs manually if you have to add many of them, such as when you make a forest. A better way is to make a custom tool where you can add tree prefabs within a circle with just a button click. And if you add too many of them, you can easily remove them with another click.

## Part 2. Add prefabs along a line

It's also kinda boring to make a wall manually. A better way is to make another custom tool where you instead of spawning trees within a circle, you spawn wall sections between waypoints.
